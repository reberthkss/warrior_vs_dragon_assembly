# 🎮 Game Balance & Strategy Notes

## Dynamic Complexity System

### Player Resources
- **Max HP**: 100
- **Health Potions**: 2 available
  - Heals: 25 HP/round
  - Duration: 2 rounds (50 HP total per potion)
  - Limited resource - must choose wisely!

## Dragon Attacks

### Fire Breath (25% chance)
- **Damage Range**: 25-40 HP (normal) | 60 HP (critical)
- **Hit Rate**: 65% (35% miss chance)
- **Critical Chance**: 15%
- **Counter Strategy**: Use Lance for evasion buff

### Stomp (25% chance)
- **Effect**: Stuns the player for 1 turn
- **Damage**: 0 (utility attack)
- **Debt Payment**: 5% of current debt
- **Counter Strategy**: Low risk, but wastes dragon turn

### Fly (25% chance)
- **Effect**: Increases dragon evasion (requires 50+ to hit)
- **Damage**: 0 (utility attack)
- **Duration**: 1 turn until reset
- **Counter Strategy**: Use Flank for guaranteed damage

### Inferno ⚡ (25% chance) - NEW DANGEROUS ATTACK
- **Damage Range**: 45-65 HP (massive)
- **Hit Rate**: 80% (ignores most evasion)
- **Cannot Miss**: 20% miss chance only
- **Threat Level**: EXTREME - can kill in 2 hits!
- **Counter Strategy**: Use potions preemptively or prioritize attacks

## Strategic Choices

### Scenario 1: Dragon Below 25% HP
- **Choice**: Attack with high damage (Flank) vs. Heal
- **Risk**: Potion cooldown may leave you vulnerable to Inferno
- **Reward**: Finish the dragon before it can act

### Scenario 2: Dragon at 50% HP
- **Choice**: Use Sword to stun vs. Build consistent damage
- **Timing**: Save 1 potion for emergencies
- **Balance**: Chip damage slowly or risk aggressive plays

### Scenario 3: Low HP (< 30)
- **Forced Decision**: Must use potion or lose
- **Trade-off**: Can't use potion for next 2 rounds (vulnerable window)
- **Alternative**: Try to dodge with Lance + evasion stacking

## Difficulty Modifiers

### Current Balance
- **Player Win Condition**: Defeat 1000 HP dragon OR reach 10,000 debt
- **Dragon Threat Level**: **HIGH** - Inferno creates real danger
- **Potion Strategy**: Essential resource, not unlimited healing

### Win Conditions
1. **Direct Victory**: Reduce dragon HP to 0
2. **Compound Interest Victory**: Accumulate 10,000 debt faster than dragon can pay (Sword + Quiz)

## Tips for Victory

✅ **Conservative Play**
- Use Lance for defensive positioning
- Save both potions until critical moments
- Focus on consistent damage (Flank)

⚡ **Aggressive Play**
- Use Sword early to stun dragon
- Combine with Flank for high damage
- Risk: Low HP = potential loss

🧠 **Balanced Play**
- Mix Sword stuns with damage abilities
- Use one potion at 50% HP
- Use Inferno's threat to time potions strategically
- Leverage compound interest through consistent attacks
